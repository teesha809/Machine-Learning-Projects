**Machine Learning Projects**

Hello There! In this Respository I've shared few Machine Learning Projects. I've used Simple Linear Regression Models, K-Nearest Neighbours Classifier,
Random Forest, Logistic Regression Model and much more. I've implemented few projects using OpenCV tool and Streamlit for creating frontend application.

You can get DataSets For each of the projects in it's README file.
